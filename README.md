# **Get Next Line: Reading Lines from Files Efficiently! 📜✨**

## **Project Overview**
The **Get Next Line** project implements the `get_next_line` function, which reads a file descriptor and returns one line at a time.
This allows efficient handling of file input, ensuring that each call retrieves the next line until the end of the file is reached. 📖🔍

## **Challenges Faced**
Implementing this function involved managing buffers dynamically and ensuring the function handles partial reads and returns the correct line format.
One of the most significant challenges was dealing with memory leaks, as careful management of allocated memory using `malloc` and `free` was crucial. 🐍💧 
Using static variables to maintain state between calls was also essential for successful line retrieval.

## **What I Learned**
Through this project, I deepened my understanding of file I/O in C, including:
- How to manage memory efficiently to avoid leaks. 🧠💡
- The importance of static variables for maintaining function state.
- Working with file descriptors and adapting to varying buffer sizes. 📏📦

Overall, **Get Next Line** was an exciting project that sharpened my skills and paved the way for more intriguing challenges ahead! 🚀🎉
